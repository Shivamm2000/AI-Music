##AI_Music_Composition

AI has been increasingly use in music composition to explore new creative possibilities and push the boundaries of what is traditionally considered as music. Here are some AI music composition experiments and techniques:

**1. Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs):**
     GANs have been to create music by training two neural networks: one to generate music and another to evaluate its quality. THis adversarial process results in the  geeration of unique and often innoative musical pieces>

**2. Transformative AI:**
     Some experiments involve using AI to transform existing music. For instance, an AI algorithm might reinterpret a classical piece in a jazz style or vice versa.

**3. AI-Generated Collaborations:**
     AI has been used to collaborate with human musicians. AI algorithms may generate a musical motif or accompaniment, and human musicians then expand upon react .
